    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.dongle_XX_soc
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off

## Troubleshooting

### GridBoss Entities Not Appearing

1. Verify firmware code is **IAAB**:
   - Check in integration configuration status
   - Look in Home Assistant logs

2. Ensure GridBoss is enabled:
   - Integration ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Update Settings
   - Check "GridBoss Connected"

3. Restart Home Assistant after enabling

### Generator Not Starting

1. Check voltage thresholds:
   - `number.dongle_XX_gridboss_generator_startup_voltage`
   - Ensure set below current battery voltage for testing

2. Verify generator is enabled:
   - `switch.dongle_XX_gridboss_generator_enabled`

3. Check physical connections

### Load Control Not Working

1. Verify load is enabled in GridBoss
2. Check power limit settings
3. Ensure physical wiring is correct
4. Monitor load current/power sensors

## Best Practices

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Test load switching and generator control during installation
2. **Set Appropriate Limits**: Configure power limits to prevent overload
3. **Monitor Phase Balance**: Keep phases balanced for optimal performance
4. **Document Connections**: Label all GridBoss connections clearly
5. **Regular Testing**: Test generator auto-start monthly

## Support

For GridBoss-specific issues:
1. Include firmware code (IAAB) in reports
2. List which GridBoss features are enabled
3. Provide debug logs with GridBoss MQTT topics
4. Include photos of physical connections if relevant
